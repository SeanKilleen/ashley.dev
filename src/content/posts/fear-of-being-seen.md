Iâ€™ve been sitting with a lot of hesitation around writing lately, especially writing publicly. Itâ€™s not because I donâ€™t have things to say. If anything, the longer Iâ€™ve been in tech, the more Iâ€™ve lived through: the shifts, the wins, the slow burns, the burnouts. The things that worked. The things that didnâ€™t. Iâ€™ve led teams, shaped programs, helped people grow, and been grown by them in return. I could write volumes.

But when it comes to hitting *publish* on a blog post, I freeze.

Part of it is that I know who follows me. I know many of them are brilliant, vocal, and deeply opinionated. Some of them are friends. Some are people Iâ€™ve admired from afar. And some, letâ€™s be honest, donâ€™t hold back when it comes to judgment. Just this week, I saw someone I follow tear apart a style of writing online. That kind of judgment makes me want to pull back into the shadows.

It chips away at whatever confidence Iâ€™ve managed to hold onto over the years.

And I used to have so much more of it. Confidence, I mean. I used to write regularly. I used to give talks, share opinions, and speak up even when I knew not everyone would agree. I believed in my voice, and I trusted it would land where it needed to.

But at some point, something dimmed. I can't name a single moment, but the spark I used to rely on started to fade. It wasnâ€™t burnout exactly. It wasnâ€™t a single failure or incident. It was just a slow, quiet shift. A drifting. A kind of hollowing out of the boldness I once carried without question.

And then I had my youngest, and everything changed again. Maybe it was the pause that parenting brings, the new rhythms, the relentless reprioritizing. Maybe it was the pandemic and the isolation that followed. But I started to feel far away. From people. From the industry. From the version of myself that was always doing, always building, always sure.

Iâ€™m not in the day-to-day weeds anymore. I donâ€™t ship code. Iâ€™m in a different season now, one thatâ€™s about nurturing, guiding, supporting from behind the scenes. And while I love that work deeply, Iâ€™ve missed the feeling of creating something tangible. Something small and scrappy and just mine.

Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve been playing around with little websites. Rebuilding old projects. Doodling in code the way I used to. Trying to remember what it feels like to build something without pressure. Without an audience. Just for the joy of it.

But even then, I hesitate to share.

The fear is still there. Fear that itâ€™s not impressive enough. That Iâ€™m not impressive enough. That someone will see the thing I made, or the thing I wrote, and decide that Iâ€™ve lost my edge. That Iâ€™m not relevant anymore. That Iâ€™m not technical enough, not deep enough, not current enough to have something worth saying.

Itâ€™s exhausting.

I look at people I admire who write every day, like my friend Cassidy, and I feel awe. She makes it look so effortless. And her consistency has inspired others around her to write, too. I love watching that ripple effect. But when I try to do it myself, it feels like trying to breathe underwater. Every post takes so much energy. I agonize over every word. I question whether the topic is important enough, whether my voice is valuable enough. And more than once, Iâ€™ve stopped before Iâ€™ve even started.

Because what if itâ€™s not good? What if no one reads it? Or worse, what if they do, and they hate it?

I wish I could say I was past all of that. That Iâ€™d grown thick enough skin by now. But the truth is: I still care. I care deeply. Not about praise, but about peopleâ€™s time. About not wasting it. About making something that feels meaningful. That adds something. That leaves people better than it found them.

And yet, something in me is shifting again. Slowly. Gently. Maybe not back to where I was, but forward into something a little more honest.

Maybe I donâ€™t need to be the loudest voice. Maybe I donâ€™t need to be prolific. Maybe I just need to show up as I am. To write not because I have some grand insight to offer, but because Iâ€™m still here, still learning, still caring, still trying to reconnect.

Because I know Iâ€™m not the only one feeling this kind of disconnection. I know Iâ€™m not the only one whose confidence has gone quiet. I know Iâ€™m not the only one quietly trying to find their way back to something they used to love.

So Iâ€™m writing this post, not as a declaration that Iâ€™m going to blog every day (I probably wonâ€™t), or that I have a new master plan (I donâ€™t). Iâ€™m writing it as a gentle reentry. A hand reaching out. A reminder to myself that taking up space, even imperfectly, is still worth doing.

And if youâ€™re reading this and nodding along, just know: youâ€™re not alone. You donâ€™t have to write every day. You donâ€™t have to have the hottest take. You donâ€™t have to prove anything. You just have to be real. Thatâ€™s enough.

Iâ€™m starting here. And if youâ€™re trying to find your way back to something too, I hope youâ€™ll start with me.

And hey, if you made it this far, Iâ€™m really grateful. Drop me a note, or donâ€™t. But it would mean a lot. ðŸ©·
